When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote when I want the repository to be accessible by other users, either
for use or for collaboration. I would also use one if I'll need to access the repository
myself from more than one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I am not the only person pushing changes to the remote, then it may change at unpredictable
times and in unpredictable ways. If those changes were suddenly applied to my working directory
without warning, they would at best startle me and at worst completely break my own project. I
should choose to pull only at times when I'm ready to understand and deal with what has changed
in the remote when I wasn't looking.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?

A branch is a single series of changes within a single repository, which is (maybe temporarily)
independent of any other series. I would make a new branch when the repository may need to have
unrelated changes committed simultaneously, and I want to choose the time in the future that those
series will be merged together. A clone is a new copy of a repository, complete with change
history, either within one Git installation or between two different installations. In the latter
case, one may be linked to the other as a remote so they can stay synchronized, but otherwise they
are independent. I would make a clone usually when I want to do local work on my own remote
repository. A fork is a clone, but specifically one that is meant to be an independent
continuation of and/or departure from the original. Forks are a special feature of GitHub,
and GitHub will link a new fork back to the original repository as a remote. I would make a fork
whenever I want to do my own work on someone else's public repository.
