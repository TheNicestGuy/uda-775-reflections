When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote when I want the repository to be accessible by other users, either
for use or for collaboration. I would also use one if I'll need to access the repository
myself from more than one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I am not the only person pushing changes to the remote, then it may change at unpredictable
times and in unpredictable ways. If those changes were suddenly applied to my working directory
without warning, they would at best startle me and at worst completely break my own project. I
should choose to pull only at times when I'm ready to understand and deal with what has changed
in the remote when I wasn't looking.
