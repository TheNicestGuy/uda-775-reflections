What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates the .git folder with metadata. Git will need the metadata to
track the history of the contents and to know how this repository behaves.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do
you think it offers?

The staging area is a virtual concept within Git, as opposed to the working directory which is a
more "physical" reflection of the file system. The repository is also virtual in a similar sense,
but it is much more permanent, whereas the staging area is temporary by design. The staging area
offers a chance to choose exactly what your commit will look like before it is set in stone.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

If your working directory contains more than one logical change, but no given file is affected
by more than one, the staging area allows you to gather only the files needed for each change one
at a time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How
would branches help?

When I want to begin a large change that will not be ready for release for some time, but I still
want myself or others to be able to release smaller fixes quickly, I can create a separate branch
for the big project. Fast, urgent work can still be done on the master branch.
