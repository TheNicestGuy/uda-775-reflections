What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates the .git folder with metadata. Git will need the metadata to
track the history of the contents and to know how this repository behaves.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do
you think it offers?

The staging area is a virtual concept within Git, as opposed to the working directory which is a
more "physical" reflection of the file system. The repository is also virtual in a similar sense,
but it is much more permanent, whereas the staging area is temporary by design. The staging area
offers a chance to choose exactly what your commit will look like before it is set in stone.
